# A-B-Testing

For this project, i will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. my goal is to work through a notebook to help the company understand if they should:

-   Implement the new webpage,
-   Keep the old webpage, or
-   Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

I divided the project into three main sections, and they are in order:
-   **Part I - Probability**
-   **Part II - A/B Test**
-   **Part III - Regression**

It was derived from the 
 * ***Probability*** section that:
   * The conversion rate on the old page is greater than the new page by 0.001578.

 * ***A/B Test*** section that:
   * We fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, so it makes us go with staying with the old page

 * ***Regression*** section that:
   * Adding new features like countries will not help in predicting the response, as there is no statistically significant linear relationship between countries or ab_page and the conversion rate.


**So, my recommendation based on this analysis is toÂ `stay with the old web page.`**
